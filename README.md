We used a dataset got from Kaggle website, then trained a deep learning based back propagation neural network (BPNN) model with the dataset. After that, the cleaned data were fed into the model for training and testing to obtain results. Finally, the neural network model reached 98.13% training accuracy and 97.97% testing accuracy.
